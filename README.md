# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This project uses Twitter's bootstrap CSS framework to bring life to my *Basic* Portfolio webpage.

With the help of the grid layout, the aesthetic of the webpage changes dramatically to bring structure to the page and its individual containers/divs. The navagation bar also brings an aesthetic piece that does away with the common hyperlink.

To navigate, simply open up the link to the **About Me** Homepage and use the navigation bar at the top right to move to the respective pages.
