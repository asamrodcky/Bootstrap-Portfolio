                Hi! My name is Samuel Rodriguez, I am 23 years old, and I live
                in Lower East Side, Manhattan, where I was born and raised. In a
                rather non-traditional route, I graduated from Cornell University in 2018
                with a Bachelors of Science in Biology, and after some time, and a slew
                of jobs I have decided to pursue technology instead of medicine.
                I currently work for an Educational Technology company named Amplify
                Education helping to develop their digital content for their Math 
                Department.
                <br>
                <br>
                My hobbies mainly revolve around keeping myself active (i.e. the gym
                and sports).
                I have played baseball my whole life, but now since school has finished,
                I have taken towards pick-up basketball considering it is the easiest 
                to coordinate. Other than my athletic hobbies, I love to travel, seeing what
                the world and its cultures have to offer, and I love to create. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What does creating mean to me? Well, I am glad you asked. The entire reason
                I decided to pursue technology was to be able to create things (websites,
                applications, games, and other devices) that serve to better people's lives
                and make completing tasks easier. Aside from that, I took 4 years of art in 
                highschool and I continue to utilize those tools that I learned to create 
                art in any way that I can: graphic design for my Instagram page and posts,
                documenting my travels with photography and videos, and in a much less academic
                sense, DJing parties and events. I think creativity is something that can be 
                exercised and is also something that a majority of people take for granted. In 
                that aspect, I continue to exercise my creativity as much as I can because
                it will only help in what I wish to do. Creativity breeds good ideas, and
                good ideas breed more steps for mankind. I hope the skills that I learn here
                help in my overall goal to push the boundaries of technology forward.
